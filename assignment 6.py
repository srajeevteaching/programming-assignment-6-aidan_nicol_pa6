# The year and month in the format YYYYMM in which the storm started
# The day of the month in which the storm started
# The time at which the storm started
# The year and month in the format YYYYMM in which the storm ended
# The day of the month in which the storm ended
# The time at which the storm ended
# The name of the state where storm occurred
# The type of storm
# The number of injuries directly caused by the storm
# The number of injuries indirectly caused by the storm
# The number of deaths directly caused by the storm
# The number of deaths indirectly caused by the storm

# this is the difference function
# What is the difference in deaths and injuries directly caused by each storm?
# Were there significant fewer, fewer, the same, more, or significantly more injuries than deaths?
# You should consider a change of +/- 1 to be no change. Changes for +/- 5 are significant.
#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




# this is the graph  function
# Create a graph that shows the number of storms with no, low, moderate moderate, and high damage to property.
# Low damage is less than 1000 and high damage is greater than 10000.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




# this is the damage function
# create a function that compares the damage to cro by the type
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




# this is for the avg
# What was the average number of days that each type of storm lasted?
# You can ignore the time of day and only look at the date. But be careful --
# if it starts and ends on teh same day, it counts as lasting for 1 day, not zero.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
